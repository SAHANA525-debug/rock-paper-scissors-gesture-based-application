# rock-paper-scissors-gesture-based-application

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

 Functional Requirements
The Rock Paper Scissors game using Gesture Based Application can vary depending on the platform
and programming language used. However, some general software requirements are:
A development environment is required for coding, testing, and debugging the application. Some
popular development environments include Visual Studio, Eclipse, and Xcode.A programming
language is required to develop the application. Common languages for developing mobile
applications include Java, Kotlin, Swift, and Objective-C. A gesture recognition library is required to
recognize the hand gestures made by the user accurately. Some popular gesture recognition libraries
include OpenCV, TensorFlow, and Caffe.
Sound Library: A sound library is required to provide audio feedback to the user. Popular sound
libraries include FMOD and OpenAL.
A graphics library is required to render graphics and animations for the application. Some popular
graphics libraries include OpenGL and DirectX. A database is required to store user data, such as
high scores and game settings. Popular databases for mobile applications include SQLite and
Firebase. A testing framework is required to test the application for bugs and errors. Popular testing
frameworks for mobile applications include Appium and Selenium.

â€¢ Python3: The entire project is developed under the language of python of version 3.10.0. Python3
can be used to develop the Rock Paper Scissors game using Gesture Based Application. Here are
some ways Python 3 can be utilized in the development of the application as has several libraries that
can be used for gesture recognition, such as OpenCV, scikit-image, and mediapipe. These libraries
allow developers to implement algorithms that can detect and recognize hand gestures made by the
user, which are essential for the Rock Paper Scissors game. It has several libraries, including Tkinter,
PyQT, and Kivy, that can be used to create the user interface of the application. These libraries provide
developers with the tools needed to create buttons, text boxes, and other graphical elements that can
be used to build a user-friendly interface. It can be used to implement the settings options in the game.
For example, the application can use Python's file handling capabilities to save and load user
preferences, such as the difficulty level or opponent's character.
