# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Gesture-Based-Application

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

 Functional Requirements
The Rock Paper Scissors game using Gesture Based Application can vary depending on the platform
and programming language used. However, some general software requirements are:
A development environment is required for coding, testing, and debugging the application. Some
popular development environments include Visual Studio, Eclipse, and Xcode.A programming
language is required to develop the application. Common languages for developing mobile
applications include Java, Kotlin, Swift, and Objective-C. A gesture recognition library is required to
recognize the hand gestures made by the user accurately. Some popular gesture recognition libraries
include OpenCV, TensorFlow, and Caffe.
Sound Library: A sound library is required to provide audio feedback to the user. Popular sound
libraries include FMOD and OpenAL.
A graphics library is required to render graphics and animations for the application. Some popular
graphics libraries include OpenGL and DirectX. A database is required to store user data, such as
high scores and game settings. Popular databases for mobile applications include SQLite and
Firebase. A testing framework is required to test the application for bugs and errors. Popular testing
frameworks for mobile applications include Appium and Selenium.

• Python3: The entire project is developed under the language of python of version 3.10.0. Python3
can be used to develop the Rock Paper Scissors game using Gesture Based Application. Here are
some ways Python 3 can be utilized in the development of the application as has several libraries that
can be used for gesture recognition, such as OpenCV, scikit-image, and mediapipe. These libraries
allow developers to implement algorithms that can detect and recognize hand gestures made by the
user, which are essential for the Rock Paper Scissors game. It has several libraries, including Tkinter,
PyQT, and Kivy, that can be used to create the user interface of the application. These libraries provide
developers with the tools needed to create buttons, text boxes, and other graphical elements that can
be used to build a user-friendly interface. It can be used to implement the settings options in the game.
For example, the application can use Python's file handling capabilities to save and load user
preferences, such as the difficulty level or opponent's character.

• Open CV: It OpenCV (Open-Source Computer Vision) is a widely-used open-source library for
computer vision and image processing tasks. It provides a comprehensive set of functions and
algorithms that enable developers to process, analyze, and manipulate images and videos efficiently.
OpenCV supports various programming languages, including C++, Python, Java, and more, making
it accessible to a wide range of developers and researchers. This versatility has contributed to its
popularity and adoption in numerous industries, from robotics and healthcare to surveillance and
entertainment.
One of the key strengths of OpenCV is its vast collection of image processing functions. These
functions allow users to perform a wide range of tasks, such as image filtering, edge detection, feature
extraction, image enhancement, and image restoration. Whether you're working on a simple image
manipulation project or a complex computer vision application, OpenCV provides the necessary tools
and algorithms to help you achieve your goals. Additionally, OpenCV offers support for image file
I/O, allowing developers to read and write images in various formats, including popular ones like
JPEG, PNG, and TIFF.

• MideaPipe: It is a powerful open-source framework developed by Google Research that simplifies
the process of building complex machine learning (ML) and computer vision (CV) applications. It
provides a flexible and scalable pipeline for processing and analyzing multimedia data, including
images, videos, and audio. With Mediapipe, developers can efficiently create applications that involve
tasks such as object detection, face recognition, hand tracking, pose estimation, augmented reality,
and more. Its modular and extensible design makes it an ideal choice for both prototyping and
production-level ML/CV projects.
One of the key advantages of Mediapipe is its comprehensive set of pre-built pipelines and models.
These ready-to-use components enable developers to quickly integrate complex ML/CV
functionalities into their applications without the need for extensive coding or algorithm development.
Whether you're a beginner exploring the world of ML/CV or an experienced developer working on
large-scale projects, Mediapipe offers a wide range of pre-trained models and pipelines that can be
easily customized and adapted to meet your specific needs.

• Python Image Library (PIL): The Python Imaging Library (PIL) is a popular open-source library
that provides a powerful set of image processing capabilities. It allows developers to easily
manipulate, enhance, and generate images in various formats. PIL supports a wide range of image
operations, including resizing, cropping, rotating, filtering, blending, and more. Whether you're
working on a simple image editing task or a complex image processing application, PIL offers the
tools and functionality to handle your image-related requirements efficiently.
One of the key strengths of PIL is its extensive file format support. It provides read and write access
to a wide range of image file formats, including popular formats such as JPEG, PNG, GIF, BMP, and
TIFF. This flexibility enables developers to work with different types of image data and seamlessly
integrate PIL into their existing workflows. Additionally, PIL allows for the conversion between
different image formats, making it convenient for tasks that involve format conversion or
interoperability.
PIL provides a comprehensive set of image manipulation functions that allow developers to perform
advanced image processing tasks. These functions include operations such as color space conversion,
histogram equalization, image blending, pixel-level manipulation, and more. PIL also offers various
image enhancement techniques, such as contrast adjustment, brightness correction, and sharpening.
These features empower developers to improve image quality, correct imperfections, and extract
useful information from images.

• Python Installer Packages (PIP): It is a package installer for Python. There are some of the packages
that are installer in gesture-based applications like pip is the default package installer for Python. It
can be used to install and manage packages from the Python Package Index (PyPI), which hosts
thousands of open-source Python packages. The required libraries such as OpenCV, MediaPipe, and
PIL can be installed using pip.
